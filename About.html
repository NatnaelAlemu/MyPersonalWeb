I was born in 1999 in D/Markos, Adiss Ababa. As for my parents, my father is an engineer and my mother is a university professor. In spite of the fact that my parents were working a lot, they always tried to find enough time to devote to me and for my smaller sister. We were growing in the atmosphere of love and respect. My parents gave me a lot of essential knowledge and lessons that I will remember all my life. My father taught me to be fearless and independent. By his example, I learned to be concentrated on what I am doing, to look calmly for the solution in any situation and to overcome difficulties. My mother taught me to be caring and respectful to others. </p>
                <p>My parents were the first role models that I was taking the example of while trying to be a good person. They taught me to care about others. I was helping my little sister with her homework as well as always asking if my grandparents needed something that I could help with. I grew up in an atmosphere of a diversity of cultures and languages. It made me open-minded and interested in the cultures of different people in the world. I was traveling a lot with my parents always discovering something unique and distinguishing about any country I visit. Such diversity also made me multilingual: I fluently speak English & Amharic. I am keen on foreign languages as well. I try to learn Spanish by myself currently. I have finished my secondary school with very good grades. That gave me the possibility to enter a college of my dream. At the college, I found myself in an even more multinational atmosphere. I made friends with my classmates from Adiss, Adama, and Hawasa. I am studying information technology. Even if some subjects seem difficult for me to understand everything fully, I try my best in order to receive nice grades. I work a lot at the college library and make deep researches with the use of online databases in order to get to know more about this or that subject. I am also a member of the students’ charitable organization. We make small but important events for the children at the hospitals in order to raise their mood. I am really proud that I can benefit in such a way for the community I live in. I am also a member of the students’ football club. I devote a lot of time to the sport. Firstly, I like it as it makes me stronger and healthier. Secondly, I believe that physical activities help to concentrate on the studies themselves as being a sportsman I am not getting tired so quickly and my brain can support more load even during the hectic exam periods. Unfortunately, I am not a leader by nature. I am a rather calm and concentrated person. Though, I can do what I need to do stable and continue until reaching a certain goal. I always try to concentrate on the result. I am good at doing repetitive work that may seem boring for the others. I know my weaknesses and I accept them, but I am trying my best to work on my strengths in order to show myself in the best way for the people. I plan to apply for a master’s scholarship and to go on a traineeship abroad. In the future, I would like to work for a big multinational company where I hope to build a successful career. “Struggle to achieve the best, with no excuses”, that’s the motto I created for myself and I try to follow it in my everyday life </p></td>
